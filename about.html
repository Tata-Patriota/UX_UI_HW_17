          Hello again! I am Renata - a product designer, specialised in UI/UX. Allow me. Without any fear of causing a
          bad impressing, I would like to share that I have been around the block.</p>
        <p class="p">After graduating in Law and business (honours), I have studied for 3 years to became a diplomat.
        </p>
        <p class="p">I have moved away from that dream when I started working as a Competition Lawyer, in Brazil. It was
          part of my job to investigated the marketâ€™s dynamics, while interviewing involved companies, clients and final
          consumers. While feeling very interested by the subject, the Lawyer life did not suit me. So, I decided to
          drift towards a more balanced lifestyle.</p>
        <p class="p">In 2018, I have immigrated to Australia. I dropped my suit, putted my leggings and became a Yoga
          Teacher,
          running my own business.</p>
        <p class="p">I have started designing my flyers digital content and website for my yoga classes. That is when it
          occurred
          to me that I quiet enjoyed doing this part of the business, which was somewhat connected with my previous
          experience and qualifications. So, in 2022, I have decided to take the Monash bootcamp to become an UI/UX
          Designer.
